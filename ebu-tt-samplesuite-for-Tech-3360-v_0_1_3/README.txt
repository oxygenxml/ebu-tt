EBU-TT Sample Files: v.0.1.3, 27/06/2013
--------------------------------------------------------------
The sample files should illustrate the application of EBU Tech 3360, MAPPING EBU STL (TECH 3264) TO EBU-TT SUBTITLE FILES, VER. 0.9. Please note that Version 0.9 of Tech 3360 is a draft document and may be updated, replaced or obsoleted by other documents at any time. The same applies to the sample files.

The sample suite demonstrates the mapping of three different features in current EBU STL files:

- The use of foreground and background colours through control codes.
- Horizontal positioning through the Justification code field (JC) in the TTI Block.
- Vertical positioning through the Vertical Position field (VP) in the TTI Block.

In addition two mappings are shown for the "subtitle-zero" convention.

Each sample mappings contain:

- One STL file as source of the sample mapping.
- One human readable XML representation of the source STL file.
- One or two EBU-TT XML documents with the recommended mapping.

If you have any question regarding the use of the samples please contact subtitling@ebu.ch or tai@irt.de.
